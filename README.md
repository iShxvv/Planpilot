# Planpilot
Planpilot is an intelligent event‑planning platform designed to reduce the time, stress, and manual effort required to organise events. Event hosts today spend significant time researching venues, comparing vendors, tracking budgets, and updating plans as circumstances change. Existing planning tools still expect hosts to do most of this work manually, offering little support beyond basic checklists. 

## Features
Planpilot streamlines this process with:
- Smart event planning workflow
- Automated research and vendor discovery
- Budget‑aware recommendations
- Real‑time updates and adaptive planning
